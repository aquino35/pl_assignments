** This project was developed by Osvaldo Aquino**


The MedianFilter.scala file, contains all the work to filter an image using the median filter process.
There are two processes presented in the work, one of them present a serial median filter, and the other
one presents a parallel median filter. The first one was implemented by using a 2D array, to examine an
input image, called inputImage.jpg(located in the project path), it divides the picture in differents "windows"
of size (windowWidth*WindowHeight) they can be of any value, as long as the number is not bigger of the input image.
It goes trough several nested for loops, with the goal of filtering the image. On the other hand, the parallel Median 
Filter, runs almost the same code except it does not uses a 2D array, it takes the input image, analyzes and it just 
returns the input image. Both methods creates a file and it appears in the out file of the project structure. 
Finally, the Future Scala class was used to compare the runtimes of both methods, the use of , and it can be
determined by the runtimes the Parallel Median Filter run faster than the Serial median filter. 
This can be said because of the test we ran and given that parallel processes tend to be faster then a serial one.
